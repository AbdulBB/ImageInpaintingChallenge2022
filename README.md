# Image Inpainting Challenge 2022
This was a simple image inpainting project that was used to fill in the holes in an image. This was a challenge in the 
course 'Programming in Python 2' at the Johannes Kepler University Linz. I already did the course, but I wanted to do 
it again to show case the students in the $2$. semster and my mentoring group. I explained the code and how to start a 
basic machine learning project in Python.
